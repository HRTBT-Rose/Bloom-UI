# Bloom-UI
An experimental HUD asset pack for UE5 using proceedurally animated paint.

Bloom is a health bar and ability icon system made to look like a stylized flower. It was desined for games with a watercolour or pastel aesthetic.

Health (or really any resource that you plug into it) is represented by the petals on the flower, petals wilt away when the value decreases, but grow back when the value is increased.

Along with the flower, Bloom contains a system for up to five customizable ability icons, represented as small pods coming off of the stem. The pods have three states: available, active and on cooldown. Pods grow and ripen when activated, but shrink down when used regrow while on cooldown.

Bloom utilizes proceedurally animated materials  which combine paint textures with vector shapes. The materials can easily be customized to use use different colours or even change the style of paint used with a number of parameters.


The template project includes a few default icon textures to show case the capability of the materials, but they are intended to be replaced by higher quality icons.
